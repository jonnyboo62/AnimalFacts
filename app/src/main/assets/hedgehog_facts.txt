Hedgehogs are small mammals known for their spiky quills.
They are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night.
Hedgehogs roll into a tight ball when threatened, using their quills as protection.
Their diet mainly consists of insects, making them insectivores.
Hedgehogs have poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell and hearing.
A baby hedgehog is called a hoglet.
Hedgehogs are found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, but not in Australia or the Americas naturally.
They can hibernate in colder climates, reducing their body temperature to match their surroundings.
Hedgehogs are solitary animals and usually only come together for mating.
The average lifespan of a hedgehog in the wild is 3-7 years.
Hedgehogs can run up to 6 km in a single night while searching for food.
Their quills are made of keratin, the same material as human hair and nails.
Hedgehogs have a unique defense mechanism where they can release a foamy saliva onto their quills.
This behavior is called self-anointing and is thought to deter predators with unfamiliar scents.
Hedgehogs have a large number of muscles at the base of their quills, allowing them to erect them when threatened.
The name 'hedgehog' comes from their foraging habits, as they are often found in hedges and make pig-like grunting sounds.
Hedgehogs have been known to travel up to 2 miles in a single night to find food.
They are immune to certain snake venoms, allowing them to eat snakes without harm.
Hedgehog's teeth are designed for grinding insects, with 36 to 44 teeth depending on the species.
Hedgehogs can suffer from a genetic condition known as Wobbly Hedgehog Syndrome, similar to multiple sclerosis in humans.
Their digestive system allows them to process toxins from insects and plants, providing a form of natural immunity.
Hedgehogs are lactose intolerant and should not be fed milk or dairy products.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists some hedgehog species as vulnerable or endangered.
Hedgehogs have a gestation period of about 35 to 58 days, depending on the species.
Climate change and habitat destruction are major threats to hedgehog populations worldwide.
Hedgehogs use a variety of vocalizations, including snuffles, grunts, and squeals, to communicate.
Their limbic system, responsible for emotions and memories, is highly developed, suggesting a complex social behavior.
Genetic studies show hedgehogs have a remarkable resistance to cancer, providing insights into cancer research.
Hedgehog populations are declining in the wild, with urban development and road mortality being significant factors.
Advanced research is exploring the use of hedgehog signaling pathways in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.
