Starfish are not actually fish, they are echinoderms, which are related to sea urchins and sand dollars.
They are also known as sea stars.
Starfish have a unique ability to regenerate lost limbs.
They can have anywhere from 5 to 50 arms.
Starfish do not have a brain; they have a simple nervous system.
They move using hundreds of tiny tube feet located on their underside.
Starfish are found in all the world's oceans, from tropical habitats to the cold seafloor.
The color of a starfish can be red, orange, pink, purple, blue, green, and many others.
They prey on mollusks like clams and oysters, and have a unique way of eating by extending their stomach out of their body.
Starfish have an eye spot at the end of each arm, allowing them to sense light and dark.
They can live up to 35 years in the wild.
The starfish's central disk must be intact for it to be able to regenerate a lost limb.
Some species of starfish can release their stomach to envelop and digest food outside their body.
Starfish have a water vascular system that pumps nutrients through their bodies and works with their tube feet for movement.
They can reproduce both sexually and asexually.
In asexual reproduction, a starfish can divide itself into two and regenerate to form two starfish.
The largest starfish ever recorded was over 3 feet in diameter.
Starfish have been part of Earth's oceans for over 450 million years.
There are over 2,000 species of starfish.
Starfish can withstand incredible pressures at the bottom of the ocean.
Some starfish species are keystone species, playing a critical role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems.
Their ability to regenerate lost limbs has inspired scientific research into regenerative medicine.
Starfish larvae are planktonic and can drift for hundreds of miles before settling down and transforming into the adult form.
The starfish's skin is covered with a hard, calcified outer layer, which provides protection.
Starfish have a compound called saponin in their bodies, which makes them taste bad to predators.
Climate change and rising ocean temperatures are threatening starfish populations by causing mass bleaching events.
Starfish exhibit a phenomenon known as 'arm autonomy' where they can voluntarily shed an arm to escape predators.
Some starfish species can change their gender from male to female or vice versa.
The genetic study of starfish has provided insights into the evolution of the deuterostome superphylum, which includes humans.
Advanced research on starfish's regenerative abilities could unlock potential treatments for diseases in humans.
