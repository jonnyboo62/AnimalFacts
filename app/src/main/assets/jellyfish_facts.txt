Jellyfish have been around for over 500 million years, making them older than dinosaurs.
Jellyfish are not actually fish; they are invertebrates, animals without backbones.
Most jellyfish are made up of 95% water.
Jellyfish don't have brains, hearts, bones, or eyes.
Jellyfish use their tentacles to sting and capture food.
A group of jellyfish is called a bloom, smack, or swarm.
Some jellyfish can glow in the dark, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence.
The largest jellyfish species is the lion's mane jellyfish, whose tentacles can extend up to 120 feet.
Jellyfish have a simple digestive cavity with only one opening for both eating and disposing of waste.
Jellyfish move by pulsating their bell-shaped body, propelling themselves through the water.
Some species of jellyfish are immortal and can revert back to their juvenile form after reaching maturity.
Jellyfish populations are increasing in some areas due to overfishing of their natural predators.
Jellyfish tentacles can still sting even after being detached from the body or after the jellyfish is dead.
Jellyfish diet consists mainly of plankton, small fish, and other jellyfish.
The box jellyfish is considered one of the most venomous marine creatures, with stings that can be fatal to humans.
Jellyfish have been sent to space for scientific research on how microgravity affects them.
The jellyfish lifecycle includes several stages: egg, larva, polyp, and medusa.
Jellyfish contribute to marine ecosystems by serving as food for a variety of predators.
Some jellyfish species can reproduce asexually, while others require a male and female for reproduction.
Climate change and warmer ocean temperatures may increase jellyfish blooms in some areas.
Jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with certain species of fish, which live among their tentacles for protection.
The venom of some jellyfish species can be used in medical research and potential treatments.
Jellyfish are capable of horizontal gene transfer, sharing genetic material with other organisms.
Certain jellyfish species exhibit complex behaviors, such as vertical migration and response to environmental stimuli.
Jellyfish play a significant role in nutrient cycling and energy transfer in marine ecosystems.
Advanced studies suggest that jellyfish nervous systems, though simple, are highly efficient in environmental adaptation.
Genomic studies of jellyfish have provided insights into the evolution of multicellular organisms.
Research on jellyfish venom has contributed to understanding cellular processes and potential drug development.
Jellyfish exhibit a wide variety of genetic adaptations that allow them to thrive in diverse marine environments.
The study of jellyfish offers valuable insights into the impacts of human activities on marine biodiversity and ecosystem health.
