Frogs are amphibians, meaning they can live both in water and on land.
Most frogs have long back legs and can jump many times their body length.
Frogs undergo metamorphosis from tadpole to adult.
A group of frogs is called an army.
Frogs absorb water through their skin rather than drinking it.
Some frog species can change their color for camouflage or temperature regulation.
Frogs have a wide range of vocalizations, used for attracting mates and signaling danger.
The world's largest frog species is the Goliath frog, which can grow up to 32 cm in length.
Frogs can be found on every continent except Antarctica.
Some frogs have toxic skin to deter predators, like the poison dart frog.
Frogs' eyes and nose are on the top of their heads, allowing them to breathe and see while submerged.
The lifecycle of a frog includes egg, tadpole, metamorphosis, and adult stages.
Frogs use their sticky tongues to catch prey quickly.
The study of amphibians and reptiles is called herpetology.
Frogs can hibernate in winter and estivate in summer to survive extreme temperatures.
Certain frogs can survive being frozen solid and then thaw out and continue living.
Frog populations are declining worldwide due to habitat loss, pollution, disease, and climate change.
Frogs play a crucial role in the ecosystem as both predators and prey, maintaining the balance of many ecosystems.
The oldest known frog lived about 190 million years ago, during the Jurassic period.
Frogs have a three-chambered heart, unlike mammals and birds which have four chambers.
Frog skin secretes a mucus which helps in keeping it moist and reduces friction while moving.
Some frogs can jump over 20 times their body length in a single leap.
The smallest frog species, the Paedophryne amauensis, measures just 7.7 mm in length.
Frog species have various breeding strategies, from laying eggs in water to carrying tadpoles on their backs.
Frogs' ear drums are visible as circular patches behind their eyes, called tympanum.
Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is used to detect frog species in a water body without seeing them.
Frogs have been found to have a remarkable ability to resist cancer, offering potential insights for human cancer research.
Some frog species use biofluorescence to absorb light and re-emit it as a different color, which may help in communication or predator avoidance.
Frog tongues can snatch prey in as little as 0.07 seconds, making it one of the fastest movements in the animal kingdom.
Frog muscle physiology and the mechanics of their jumping are studied to inspire robotic designs and improve understanding of muscular function in vertebrates.
