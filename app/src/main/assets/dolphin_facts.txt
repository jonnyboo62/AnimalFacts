Dolphins use a wide range of sounds and movements to communicate with each other.
There are over 40 species of dolphins, with sizes ranging from 4 feet to over 30 feet long.

Most dolphins have a diet that consists mainly of fish and squid.
Dolphins live in groups called pods, which can have just a few or many hundred members.
The bottlenose dolphin is one of the most well-known and studied dolphin species.
Dolphins have a layer of fat called blubber under their skin to keep them warm in cold waters.
Dolphins can swim up to 20 miles per hour and are highly agile in the water.
Some dolphin species can dive as deep as 1,000 feet in search of food.
Dolphins use echolocation to find food and navigate in murky waters, sending out clicks and listening for the echoes.
A dolphin's brain is large in comparison to its body size, which is a sign of high intelligence.
Dolphins have been known to display cultural behavior, such as passing knowledge from one generation to the next.
